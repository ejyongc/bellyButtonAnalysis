# bellyButtonAnalysis

In this project, we have created a interactive dashboard utilizing javaScript and HTML for the company "Improbable Beef". This dashboard allows the company to share the belly button bacteria sample results with the volunteers they used on their study.  

The goal of the interactive dashboard is to identify the top 10 bacteria species in each volunteer's belly buttons.  With this information, the volunteers could qualify as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef.
